# SmartFunds
A prototype of an Agentic AI assistant that helps college students manage their personal finances.

# Features
## 1. Scholarship Matching
SmartFunds parses through a student's uploaded resume to match a student to a scholarship based on GPA, Academic Interests, and demographics. It tracks the essays a student has already written and outputs how much effort, on a scale of 1-10, the student would need to take to apply to each new scholarship. It also reminds the student about upcoming deadlines and offers help outlining the required essays.

## 2. Dynamic Budget Builder
After the user inputs details like meal plan, tuition, housing, savings, spending habits, and income, SmartFunds tracks their spending across categories and predicts future savings or debt. It also sends alerts like "You're on track to lose funds by finals week unless you reduce spending by X" so you know how to manage your funds.

## 3. Form Filling Agent
SmartFunds examines documents like a W-2, income statement, etc., and assists a student filling out their FAFSA or filing their taxes. It sends reminders for missing data and upcoming deadlines, as well as tracks income that needs to be filed for taxes. It will explain any confusing terms to you as well, de-mystifying these processes.

## 4. Credit Coach
SmartFunds breaks down credit for students and recommends first credit cards or secure loans based on their spending habits. It tracks the user's credit score (synced to a site like Credit Karma) and simulates "what-if" scenarios regarding real-life scenarios, like missing a credit card payment, and suggests an action plan for them.

## Conclusion
With all these features, SmartFunds streamlines multi-step and interdependent financial workflows (like adjusting your college budget based on your scholarships, or filling out the FAFSA and your taxes jointly) in a way customized to you. Unlike a traditional system, SmartFunds proactively suggests things (before you may think of them) and utilizes long-term memory to target you increasingly effectively. For example, through demonstrated behavior SmartFunds may learn that you apply for more merit-based scholarships than need-based, and that you tend to procrastinate. In response, it will mainly search for merit-based scholarships and send you suggestions to apply earlier on and have more consistent reminders.
